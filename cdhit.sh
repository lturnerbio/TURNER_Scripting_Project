# default is the code below
# -i is the input file in fasta format
# -o is the output destination and file name (two output files: fasta sequences file and list of clusters file)
# -c is the sequence identity threshold (default is 0.9)
# -n is the word length paired to -c (check userguide for values, default is 10)
# -d length of description in cluster list file (default is 20)
# -M memory limit in mb for the program (0 for unlimited, use queue to assign memory limit)
# -T number of threads (0 means all CPUs will be used, set CPU limit using queue)
