# TURNER_Scripting_Project
Repo for Scripting for Biologists class

For this project I will write a script to run all of the necessary steps to trim, analyze, and assemble reads into a transcriptome for the gray snapper Lutjanus griseus. I am currently already working on this project in my lab, but for this class I will assemble all of the necessary code into a script that can be executed once. The script will be written in bash and will be run remotely on the Alabama supercomputer. If I have the time I will also run this script for another species (lane snapper Lutjanus synagris) that another member of my lab is working on to show that the script works for multiple species.
